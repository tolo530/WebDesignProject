                <h3>A small story</h3>
                <p>My dream was to offer a place where people could sit and relax, meanwhile, they enjoy good tea and something to eat.
                    Since I was a child, my parents brought me to different cities in the south of Spain. I fell in love with the city of Granada.
                    This city has a lot of tea shops near the Alhambra and I had the privilege of tasting a well-done tea in fabulous tea shops.</p>
                <p>When I returned to my country, I decided to create the same good experience in my city. Some of the feelings I want to transmit are:
                    to close your eyes and to feel you are in a special place, the pleasure of taste delicious food, feel how your senses respond to the
                    fragrance of our teas..</p>

                <h3>Tea shop info</h3>
                <p>Our tea shop offers different rooms, with different landscapes. Firstly we have Greenroom, it symbolizes
                    life and the young spirit. Blueroom symbolizes the adventure of finding new places. And the last, brown
                     which symbolize the present, to remember us to enjoy the moment.</p>
